The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate the functionality of the [YouTube Library](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/)
for Android which acts as an API for the main YouTube application. You can use it as reference for implementing playback functionality within your own application.

The app covers everything from popup players:
