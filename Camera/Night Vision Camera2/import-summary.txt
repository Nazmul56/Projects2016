ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.
/home/nazmul/Desktop/UnderDevelopment/Night Vision Camera2
                                           -      -       

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From Night Vision Camera:
* ic_launcher-web.png
* project.properties~
From actionbarsherlock:
* R.java

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => nightVisionCamera/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => nightVisionCamera/src/main/assets/
* libs/StartApp.jar => nightVisionCamera/libs/StartApp.jar
* libs/google-play-services.jar => nightVisionCamera/libs/google-play-services.jar
* libs/mobilecore_V0.9.4.jar => nightVisionCamera/libs/mobilecore_V0.9.4.jar
* libs/notifysdk-release.jar => nightVisionCamera/libs/notifysdk-release.jar
* res/ => nightVisionCamera/src/main/res/
* src/ => nightVisionCamera/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
